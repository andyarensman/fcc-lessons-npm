FreeCodeCamp's introduction lessons to NPM, completed. This is part of the APIs and Microservices certification. You can find the lessons on [FreeCodeCamp here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/#managing-packages-with-npm)

Here is FreeCodeCamp's description of the lesson:
>npm (Node Package Manager), is a command line tool to install, create, and share packages of JavaScript code written for Node.js. There are many open source packages available on npm, so before starting a project, take some time to explore so you don't end up recreating the wheel for things like working with dates or fetching data from an API.
>
>In this course, you'll learn the basics of using npm, including how to work with the package.json and how to manage your installed dependencies.
